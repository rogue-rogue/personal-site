    <h1> Day 3 </h1> 
      <p> Had lots of difficulty getting the stylesheet to link up to my content. Realised that I had a typo in the file name (styles 
        instead of style). RIP me. I figured this out because I put a style component in which worked, and then went to re-write the 
        link and noticed the typo. I also realised the site wasn't building when this typo was there (which I saw in actions). 
        
        Once I got the stylesheet working, I also noticed that some of the fonts I tried wouldn't show, and it would revert to times new roman. But this wasn't 
        always the case. I looked back at my font list and realised some of them had disclaimers like: <br>
        
        Note: This font may not display on iOS, Windows, or Android devices. <br> 
        
        So I need to look at how fonts get pulled onto the site for different devices.
        
        Also, my stylesheet won't link to these sub html files, only the index file. Not sure why this is.
