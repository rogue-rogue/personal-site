    Let's look at CSS closer today. 
    
    The universal selector * can select any elements of a given type
    
    Attributes: name="value" 
    
    class: 
    Attributes within tags, custom name which is linked in css file with .custom_name 
    We can add multiple classes to an HTML element’s class attribute by separating them with a space. 
    
    ID = "page-number" / #page-number{} 
    If an HTML element needs to be styled uniquely, we can give it an ID using the id attribute.
    
    style = "color: Green" 
    
    src: 
    
    href: 
    
    target: 
    
    There are so many attributes: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes
    
    
    We can specifically style elements with different attributes. 
    
    Attributes can be selected similarly to types, classes, and IDs. We use square brackets. 
    This example makes all the hyperlinks magenta. 
    [href]{
       color: magenta;
    }
    
    Or we can get more granular: 
    type[attribute*=value]. 
    In short, this code selects an element where the attribute contains any instance of the specified value.
    
    These are all examples of pseudo-class selectors in action! In fact, :focus, :visited, :disabled, and :active are all pseudo-classes. Factors such as user interaction, site navigation, and position in the document tree can all give elements a different state with pseudo-class.

    A pseudo-class can be attached to any selector. It is always written as a colon : followed by a name. For example p:hover.

p:hover {
  background-color: lime;
}

To make styles easy to edit, it’s best to style with a type selector, if possible. If not, add a class selector. 
If that is not specific enough, then consider using an ID selector.
    
    IDs are the most specific selector in CSS, followed by classes, and finally, type
