    <h1>Day 2</h1> 
    <p>Had a little trouble working out how I was going to branch this repo because I can only see changes pushed to main branch. <br>
        I want to keep a copy of my old changes and preview the new changes before combining with the old ones. </p>  
    
    <h2>Todays work</h2> 
    <h3>Indentation and Spacing</h3> 
    <p>A bit of research has led me to the following ruleset: <br>
      <ul> 
        <li>Do not place more than one block element on one same line</li> 
        <li>Nest ever in line element inside a block element</li> 
        <li>Line limit is 100 char except for URLS</li>
        <li>Breaks are not for vertical space they're for paragraphs. Max 1 per row.</li> 
        <li>No whitespace between braces and element names</li> 
        <li>Use h1 tag only once per page for search engine ranking</li>
        <li>Don't use caps in markup, do it in the CSS instead</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
        
    <h3>Element Attributes</h3>
    <p>Within element opening tags, we can add attributes which provide additional information. <br>
        These attributes follow a name="value" syntax. <br>
        We can use HTML native attributes such as: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>alt</li>
          <li>src</li>
          <li>a or target</li> 
        </ul>
        <br>  
        We can find a full list of these attributes <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes"  target="_blank">here</a>. <br>
