    <h1> Day 2 </h1> 
      <p> Had a little trouble working out how I was going to branch this repo because I can only see changes pushed to main branch. 

          I want to keep a copy of my old changes and preview the new changes before combining with the old ones.

          Sort the branching 
          Continue work on attributes: 

          Within elements, we can use attributes to add information. 
        These attribuets use the following syntax: 


    Attribute Name and Values
    HTML attributes consist of a name and a value using the following syntax: name="value"
    These can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element to configure or change the behavior of the element.
    
    An example of these attributes being used is:

      Unique ids
      Unique ID Attributes
      In HTML, specific and unique id attributes can be assigned to different elements in order to differentiate between them.

      When needed, the id value can be called upon by CSS and JavaScript to manipulate, format, and perform 
      specific instructions on that element and that element only. Valid id attributes should begin with a letter and should only 
      contain letters (a-Z), digits (0-9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and periods (.).
