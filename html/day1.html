    <h1> Chit chat </h1> 
      <p> Today is the first day back at the computer since my interview that went bad. I've decided to change my approach to learning and accountability by 
      experimenting with some daily targets and topics.
      </p>

    <h1> Small targets </h1>
      <ul> 
        <li> Start a new repo </li>
        <li> Try a notetaking formula </li>
        <li> Refresh some of the html knowledge (I think this format will be helpful for that?) </li>
      </ul> 

    <h1> Learning Summary </h1>

        <p> HTML kicks off with a Document Type Declaration. This is is the instruction to the browser about the type of document and the version of HTML
            <!DOCTYPE html> <br>

            After this declaration we introduce the first element: <html> HTML Element <br>
            The root of an HTML document, all content/structure for an HTML document should be contained between the opening and closing <html> tags. <br>

            We then start to fill out parts of the structure. It's got a head and a body. <br>
        </p>

        <h2> Head </h2>
            <p> The head contains all the metadata which doesn't actually appear on the page. This could include a title, 
            html native style specifiers and a link to a css style sheet. <br>

        <h2> Body </h2> 
        <p> This is where we store the elements that should actually be displayed. <br>
            The most foundational of these elements are basic text styling: <br>
            <ul> 
                <li> Headings h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 </li> 
                <li> Paragraphs/Blocks of text p </li> 
                <li> Italics/emphasis em </li> 
                <li> Strong/bold strong </li> 
            </ul>
         <br> 
         We can add line breaks with br --> opener only tags
         <br> 
         We can also put these elements into containers *cue the ooohs*. These containers are exactly as they sound. 
         There are two containers I'm aware of currently.  <br> 
             <ol> 
                    <li> div elements can contain flow content such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, etc. </li> 
                    <li> span elements separate pieces of text within paragraphs so they can be differently formatted </li> 
             </ol>
         <br> 
         
        
        We can implement lists of items such as ordered lists via ol and unordered lists via ul. 
        We can implement multimedia content such as videos and images.
